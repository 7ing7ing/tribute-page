          <h2>Random things cats do</h2>
        </div>

       <ul>
         <li>Casually sitting on someone’s laptop when they’re working Turns out
          freelancers in Starbucks do NOT appreciate you taking a seat on their
          keyboard mid-type. Who knew?</li>
      <li>Headbutting people as a sign of affection I think this is adorable.
          The loved ones telling me to ‘stop that’ clearly do not.</li>
        <li>Begging for affection then viciously clawing people when they give
          it This will quickly earn you a reputation as someone who ‘runs a bit
          hot and cold’ or is ‘not great at dating’. Whatever.</li>
       <li>Pooping in a box and making someone else clean it up for us Not
          that we want to do this one. It’s just another way cats display their
          dominance. 33 tweets that prove cats are dicks</li>
      <li>Skipping the delicious tap and bottled water you’re offered so you
          can drink dirty puddle water instead Makes sense.
<li>Frantically running up and downstairs for an hour at around 3pm
          every day Can I live?</li>
<li>Giving people dead mice and other small animals as a way to show
          your love I’m sorry, do you not appreciate this lovely gift that I
          caught with my bare hands (even if the experts say that it’s not
          actually love they’re showing)?</li>
      <li>Coughing up hairballs and then just leaving them on the floor I’m
          not sure I want to live in a world that doesn’t allow me to puke on
        the floor and do nothing to clean it up.</li>
        <li>Ignoring thoughtful presents and getting excited about the boxes
          instead No, I have not ‘ruined Christmas’ or ‘been totally
          unappreciative’. I’m just taking joy in the simple things, like this
          box. You know, instead of that iPad you gave me.</li>
        <li> Playing with tiny sticks with feathers attached Sometimes the mood
          just strikes.</li>
       <li>Getting high on catnip and rolling around on the carpet Not
          acceptable behaviour in the office, apparently.</li>
        <li>Licking yourself clean Fine when you’ve dropped a tiny bit of
          chocolate on yourself, not cool when you’re licking yourself from
          wrist to shoulder. For some reason.</li>
        <li>Licking your friends clean It’s just another way to show your
          love.</li>
        <li>Purring to show approval What do you MEAN this is an inappropriate
          way to discuss things in meetings? I’m saying your idea is good. God.
          Back off.</li>
        <li> Napping for 80% of the day This is deeply unfair.</li>
        <li>Waiting by doors and making loud noises until someone lets you
          outside Sure, I could open this myself. But why would I do that when
          you’ll do it for me?</li>
        <li>Then refusing to go outside Actually, no. I changed my mind.
          Indoors is nice. MORE : 6 signs your cat really loves you</li>
        <li>Rolling onto your back to demand people rub your tummy AKA my
          go-to first date move.</li>
        <li>Tapping anything resting on a surface so it crashes to the ground
          Taking joy in mindless destruction: fine for cats, psychopathic for
          humans.</li>
<li>Demanding that someone delivers food into a bowl for you every
          day, and loudly complaining when they’re a few minutes late How DARE
          they.</li>
<li>Adorably sitting on someone so they’re unable to get up and get on
          with their day No, no. Don’t worry about getting yourself a cup of tea
          or going for work. I would like some attention, and I am important.</li>
<li>Following friends into the bathroom to watch them pee or take a
          bath Again, not that we want to do this. It just seems unfair that
          cats are allowed to do this and we’re not.</li>
<li>Constantly invading people’s personal space If you don’t want me
          to climb on your head just say something. It’s fine. I won’t be
          deeply, personally offended.</li>
       <li>Kneading people with your paws to show how much you adore them WHY
          DON’T YOU APPRECIATE MY LOVE?</li>
 <li>Carefully finding warm places around the house to pee Like behind
          the TV, or under the sofa. For peeing.</li>
      <li>Remaining blissfully unaware of all of life’s various
          responsibilities and injustices Oh.</li>
     <li>And of course, unrolling all the toilet paper for the lols</li>
